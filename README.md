# P2P-Video-Call-Program

A nodejs server creates a private room for you when the site opens. It allows you to establish a p2p connection between you and other people who enter the link of this private room. After this connection is established, the server goes out of the way and browsers continue their serverless communication securely. 
This is only the beta version of the project.
